# GraphProject-AmeBranch

So the project is ready for the implementation of the algorithms, I've changed the structure after some
annoying problems with pointers etcâ€¦ I'm now on a structure that use only a map from Node to the Adjacent ones,
this structure is come up to be better cause the run of some algorithms will be more easy and faster, in addiction to that
I have removed the entire edge class, and solved (apparently) all my problems with the pointers.
Read the code and let me know for some explanation, if needed.
