# GraphProject-Main

This is a small project on building a small software that enables you 
to simulate graph algorithm as Djikstra via graphical implementation.
Has been made a simple graphical implementation for build and move around the 
graph (this include naming the nodes, weighting the edges) and will build a 
directed graph as the image shows.
