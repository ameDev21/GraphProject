# GraphProject

So the project is ready for the implementation of the algorithms, I've changed the structure after some
damn annoying problems with pointers etcâ€¦ I'm now on a structure that use only a map from Node to the Adjacent one
this structure is better to cause the run of some algorithms will be more easy and faster, in addiction that I have removed
the entire edge class, and solved (apparently) all my problems with the pointers.
